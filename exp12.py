"""
Implement programs using tuple

Accessing elements:
Retrieve a specific element by index: my_tuple[index]
Retrieve a range of elements using slicing: my_tuple[start:end]
Access the last element using negative indexing: my_tuple[-1]

Concatenation:
Concatenate two tuples: new_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2

Multiplication:
Create a new tuple with repeated elements: new_tuple = my_tuple * n

Unpacking:
Assign multiple values from a tuple to variables: var1, var2, var3 = my_tuple

Checking length and presence:
Get the length of the tuple: len(my_tuple)
Check if an element is present in the tuple: element in my_tuple

Searching and counting:
Find the index of an element: my_tuple.index(element)
Count the occurrences of an element: my_tuple.count(element)

Converting to a list:
Convert a tuple to a list: my_list = list(my_tuple)

Creating a single-element tuple:
Create a single-element tuple (with a comma): my_tuple = (element,)

Unpacking with * operator (Python 3):
Assign the first element to a variable and the remaining elements to another variable: var1, *var2 = my_tuple

Nested tuples:
Tuples can be nested to create more complex data structures.
